NAME
        juggernaut - generate makefile streams for a depenendency set

DESCRIPTION
        Juggernaut is small haskell api used to generate a make file
        for doing upstream/downstream builds of a dependency set.

        It currently only generates a basic skeleton of a makefile. In
        future the plan is to generate an include file or a complete 
        makefile based upon some configuration options.

        The name juggernaut has been used for hysterical raisins stemming
        from an old ant build project.

USAGE
        T.B.A.

STATE
        The `juggernaut` library is experimental only and will be 
        highly volatile for the near future.
